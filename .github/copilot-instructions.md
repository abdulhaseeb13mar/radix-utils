## Project Summary

This TypeScript npm package for Radix DLT utilities is complete and ready for use. The package includes:

### Core Features

- **fetchValidatorInfo**: Comprehensive validator data fetching
- **checkResourceInUsersFungibleAssets**: Resource balance checking across accounts
- **computeValidatorFeeFactor**: Fee calculation with pending changes
- **BN**: High-precision decimal operations
- **calculateEstimatedUnlockDate**: Epoch-based date calculations

### Package Structure

- Modular architecture in `src/` with separate folders for types, validators, and utils
- Full TypeScript support with generated declaration files
- Comprehensive test suite using Jest
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Examples showing usage patterns
- Complete documentation for publishing and extending

### Ready for Publishing

- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm test` - Runs test suite (all tests passing)
- `npm run lint` - Code quality checks
- `npm publish` - Ready to publish to npm registry

### Extensible Design

The architecture makes it easy to add more utility functions:

1. Create new modules in appropriate folders
2. Add TypeScript types as needed
3. Export from main index.ts
4. Add tests and documentation

The package is ready for immediate use and can be extended with additional Radix DLT utility functions as needed.
